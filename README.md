# Course Overview

The Introduction to Machine Learning course on Kaggle covered the fundamental concepts of machine learning using Python. This course is designed for beginners and provides hands-on experience with the basic techniques and tools used in the field of machine learning.

## Course Contents

The course is divided into several lessons, each focusing on a different aspect of machine learning. Below is a summary of the lessons covered:

1. **How Models Work** - Introduction to the basic idea of machine learning and how models make predictions.
2. **Basic Data Exploration** - Techniques for exploring and understanding data using pandas.
3. **Your First Machine Learning Model** - Building a simple machine learning model with scikit-learn.
4. **Model Validation** - Techniques for evaluating model performance.
5. **Underfitting and Overfitting** - Understanding the concepts of underfitting and overfitting and how to address them.
6. **Random Forests** - Introduction to the random forest algorithm and its applications.
7. **Machine Learning Competitions** - Insights into participating in machine learning competitions on Kaggle.

## Repository Contents
